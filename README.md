### Description of the Project

Thanks to the Sport with AI mobile application, people who want to do sports and stay healthy gather on a single platform without the need for another application. With the social media section in our application, interaction between users is increased, a sense of competition is created among users with the league ranking, and the habit of doing sports activities is gained. Thanks to these and similar features, our application has a more extensive usage area than other applications. In the spring term, most of the front-end and back-end developments of the project were completed and the final period planning was created by the team and the task distribution was made.

### The Goals of the Project

Purpose of the Project The most general aim of the project is to make our user feel himself in the gym thanks to artificial intelligence technology while doing sports.

In short, the things we aim to do with our application are:
1. When you do a sports move wrong in the gym, someone around you will show you how to do it right, but this is not possible when doing sports at home. In order to eliminate this situation, we added the "Do sports with artificial intelligence" option in the application. It will be enough for the user to use this feature just to open the camera and put the phone in front of the area where he will do sports. Our artificial intelligence model will detect 32 different points on the human body and check the accuracy of the movement. If the user is doing the sports movement incorrectly, our artificial intelligence model will warn the user and show how the movement is done correctly. In this way, the user will perform an inefficient sports activity by making an incorrect sports action, and thanks to our artificial intelligence model, he will have done both an efficient and enjoyable sports activity.

2. It is aimed that users can do a more disciplined sport by accessing their historical data.

3. Users can be active in the application by sharing photos, videos and surveys from the social media section and can deliver the content they produce to other users.

4. There will be a league ranking among users. This league ranking will be calculated based on their weekly activity. In this way, it is aimed to create a competitive environment among users and increase their motivation.
